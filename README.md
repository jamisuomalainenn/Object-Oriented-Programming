Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) ‚Äì C# Exercises

Welcome to my Object-Oriented Programming repository! This collection showcases various assignments and exercises completed during my studies in C#. The tasks primarily focus on fundamental OOP principles such as classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

üìÇ Repository Structure

The repository is organized into multiple folders, each corresponding to a specific exercise or task. Notable folders include:

BookAndAuthor: Demonstrates relationships between books and authors.

CarExercise: Implements a car class with various attributes and methods.

CompanyExercise: Models a company structure with employees and departments.

Shapes: Implements different geometric shapes using inheritance.

Store: Simulates a store with inventory management (note: this task is partially completed).

FileExercise: Handles file operations and data processing (note: this task is partially completed).

‚úÖ Task Completion Status

Most tasks were successfully completed. However, a few presented challenges, leading to incomplete submissions. Specifically:

Store: Nearly finished; final touches were not added.

FileExercise: Approximately half of the required features were implemented; finalization was pending.

Despite these unfinished tasks, I am satisfied with the progress made, considering the time constraints and my experience level.
